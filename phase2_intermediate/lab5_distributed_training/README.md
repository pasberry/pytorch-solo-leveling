# Lab 5: Distributed Training 🚀

> **Time:** 3-4 hours | **Difficulty:** Advanced

## Topics
- DataParallel (DP) vs DistributedDataParallel (DDP)
- FSDP for large models
- Gradient accumulation
- Mixed precision training
- Multi-node setup

## Exercises
1. Train model with DDP
2. Compare DP vs DDP performance
3. Use FSDP for large model

## Solution
See Phase 4 Lab 1 for complete FSDP implementation

## Next: Lab 6 - Model Export!
