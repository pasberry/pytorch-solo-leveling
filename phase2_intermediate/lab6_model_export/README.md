# Lab 6: Model Export & Optimization ⚡

> **Time:** 2-3 hours | **Difficulty:** Intermediate

## Topics
- TorchScript (tracing and scripting)
- ONNX export for cross-platform
- Dynamic quantization (INT8)
- Model pruning
- Latency benchmarking

## Exercises
1. Export model to TorchScript
2. Export to ONNX
3. Apply quantization
4. Benchmark latency improvements

## Solution
See Phase 4 Lab 4 for complete serving implementation

## Next: Phase 2 Checkpoint Project!
