# PyTorch Solo Leveling 🚀

> **"Level up from PyTorch Beginner to Production ML Expert"**

A comprehensive, hands-on curriculum for mastering PyTorch and building Meta-scale machine learning systems.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This curriculum takes you from **beginner → advanced → expert** through:
- ✅ **Phase 1:** PyTorch Foundations (Tensors, Training Loops, CNNs)
- ✅ **Phase 2:** Intermediate Deep Learning (Transformers, Distributed Training, Optimization)
- ✅ **Phase 3:** Applied Meta-Scale Projects (Feed Ranking, Video Understanding, Embeddings, Speech)
- ✅ **Phase 4:** Expert Topics (Production Systems, Fairness, Advanced Optimization)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up your environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Read the full curriculum
cat CURRICULUM.md

# 4. Start Phase 1
cd phase1_foundations
```
